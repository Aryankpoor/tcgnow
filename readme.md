# TCG NOW
All in one hub for tcg checklists, previews , availability and genuine trading/buy-sell platform.

Currently only Match Attax 224-25 and Cricket Attax 2011 are active, as that is the only data I have been able to pull yet, but I am still adding data and new features daily. It is currently up and running and you can see the working website when you visit these pages. 

Once you open up a collection, you will see a table of the checklist, which you can also download as a document for your reference, or download the actual checklist and binder covers image! You can hover over a card name to view its image or click it to view it's profile! Fun facts about each collection is included in their pages!
